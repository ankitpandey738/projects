      <h2>BMW M1000RR </h2>
      <p><strong>Price:</strong> ₹55,00,000</p>
      <p>Every aspect of the BMW M 1000 RR is designed with purpose, from form to function, making it not just a machine but a statement on the track. The M brake ducts and optional M Aero wheel covers were created in collaboration with BMW Motorsport experts. The M brake ducts are directly integrated into the new front-wheel mudguards, which in turn have been optimised for improved airflow around the fork legs and brake calipers. Their first time in use on a series motorcycle, the M brake ducts reduce the temperature of the brake calipers. The BMW M1000RR also features M Aero wheel covers, made of visible carbon, which reduce turbulence at the front wheel and unleash your bike’s full potential on long straights at speeds greater than 250 km/h.</p>
